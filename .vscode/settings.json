  // How to activate HTTPS
  // Why? To access the motion sensors on iOS devices, you need to use HTTPS

  // Step 1: Generatie HTTPS certificates (see below)
  // Step 2: Uncomment the following settings (liveServer.settings.https)
  //         Attention: there needs to be a comma at the end of the line above
  // Step 3: Replace USERNAME with your MacOS username in these settings
  // Step 4: Run the server e.g. with LiveServer Extension
  // Step 5: Open the URL in your browser on the iPhone with https://YOURIP:5502

  // "liveServer.settings.https": {
  //   "enable": true, //set it true to enable the feature.
  //   "cert": "/Users/USERNAME/localhost-cert.pem", //full path of the certificate
  //   "key": "/Users/USERNAME/localhost-key.pem", //full path of the private key

  Generate HTTPS certificates on MacOS locally

  ## Step 1: Find out your IP address

  > ipconfig getifaddr en0
  
  This will return an IP address, e.g. 172.20.23.170
  Copy (CMD+C) this IP address to use it in the next step
  
  ## Step 2: Generate certificates
  Important: paste your IP address as an additional parameter
  
  > mkcert -key-file ~/localhost-key.pem -cert-file ~/localhost-cert.pem -install localhost 127.0.0.1 172.20.23.170

  Done!
  Attention: each time you're on a new network, you need to generate new certificates with the new IP address
